    <h1>Cosmetology Diploma (D55140)</h1>
    
    <p>The Cosmetology curriculum is designed to provide competency-based knowledge, scientific/artistic principles, and hands-on fundamentals associated with the cosmetology industry. The curriculum provides a simulated salon environment which enables students to develop manipulative skills.

Course work includes instruction in all phases of professional imaging, hair design, chemical processes, skin care, nail care, multi-cultural practices, business/computer principles, product knowledge, and other selected topics.

Graduates should qualify to sit for the North Carolina State Board of Cosmetic Arts examination. Upon successfully passing the State Board exam, graduates will be issued a license. Employment is available in beauty salons and as skin/nail specialists, platform artists, and related businesses.

All applicants for a diploma in cosmetology must have completed all courses, 1500 hours (as specified), and live performances and mannequin services. Students must have an overall average of 2.0 or higher to receive the certificate.

When Cosmetology students leave the laboratory, they must clock out. To earn hours in Cosmetology, students must be physically present in the laboratory.</p>
